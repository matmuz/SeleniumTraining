# SeleniumTraining

A collection of Selenium Basic tasks (in form of tests) from Sii's moderntester platform with my solution. Those are simple scripts that present different WebElements handling and Selenium usage rather than anything else, but should you want to run these tests I would recommend using an IDE. Open the IDE and run tests there (Run testng.xml file for parallel execution - Java/Maven required). I have also implemented very basic (without methods) Page Objects just for the scripts to look cleaner.
